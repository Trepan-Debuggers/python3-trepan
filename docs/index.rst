trepan3k - a gdb-like debugger for Python 3
===========================================

trepan3k is a gdb-like debugger for Python. It is a rewrite of *pdb*
from the ground up. It is aimed for people who care about high-quality
debuggers

A command-line interface (CLI) is provided as well as an remote access
interface over TCP/IP.

See the Tutorial_ for ways to enter the debugger. See ipython-trepan_ for using this
in *ipython* or an *ipython notebook*.

This package is for Python 3. See trepan2_ for the same
code modified to work with Python 2.

An Emacs interface is available via realgud_.
