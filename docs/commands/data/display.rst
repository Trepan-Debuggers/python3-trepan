Display (set display expression)
--------------------------------

**display** [ *format* ] *expression*

Print value of expression *expression* each time the program stops.
*format* may be used before *expression* and may be one of `/c` for
char, `/x` for hex, `/o` for octal, `/f` for float or `/s` for string.

For now, display expressions are only evaluated when in the same
code as the frame that was in effect when the display expression
was set.  This is a departure from gdb and we may allow for more
flexibility in the future to specify whether this should be the
case or not.

With no argument, evaluate and display all currently requested
auto-display expressions.
