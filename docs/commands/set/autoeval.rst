Set Auto Eval
-------------

**set autoeval** [ **on** | **off** ]

Evaluate unrecognized debugger commands.

Often inside the debugger, one would like to be able to run arbitrary
Python commands without having to preface Python expressions with
``print`` or ``eval``. Setting *autoeval* on will cause unrecognized
debugger commands to be *eval*'d as a Python expression.

Note that if this is set, on error the message shown on type a bad
debugger command changes from:

::

      Undefined command: "fdafds". Try "help".

to something more Python-eval-specific such as:

::

      NameError: name 'fdafds' is not defined

One other thing that trips people up is when setting autoeval is that
there are some short debugger commands that sometimes one wants to use
as a variable, such as in an assignment statement. For example:

::

      s = 5

which produces when *autoeval* is on:

::

      Command 'step' can take at most 1 argument(s); got 2.

because by default, ``s`` is an alias for the debugger ``step`` command.
It is possible to remove that alias if this causes constant problem.
