Set Events
----------
**set events** [*event* ...]

Sets the events that the debugger will stop on. Event names are:

.. hlist::
   :columns: 3

   * `c_call`
   * `c_exception`
   * `c_return`
   * `call`
   * `exception`
   * `line`
   * `return`

`all` can be used as an abbreviation for listing all event names.

Changing trace event filters works independently of turning on or off
tracing-event printing.

Examples:
+++++++++

::

  set events line        # Set trace filter for line events only.
  set events call return # Trace calls and returns only
  set events all         # Set trace filter to all events.
