Condition (add condition to breakpoint)
---------------------------------------

**condition** *bp_number* *condition*

*bp_number* is a breakpoint number. *condition* is an expression which
must evaluate to *True* before the breakpoint is honored.  If *condition*
is absent, any existing condition is removed; i.e., the breakpoint is
made unconditional.

::

   condition 5 x > 10  # Breakpoint 5 now has condition x > 10
   condition 5         # Remove above condition
