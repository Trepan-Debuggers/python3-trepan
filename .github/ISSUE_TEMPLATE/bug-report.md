name: Bug report
about: Tell us about trepan3k bugs

---

<!--
Bugs are also not for general or novice help on how to install this Python program in your environment in the way you would like to
have it set up, or how to interpret a Python traceback.

For these kinds of things, you will save yourself time by asking instead on forums like StackOverflow that are geared to helping people for such general or novice kinds of questions and tasks.

Unless you are a sponsor of the project, it could take a while before the bug report is noticed. Bug reports that don't follow instructions here, or look like little thought and effort put into reporting a problem, may be met with the same quality of thought can care in
response.

To set expectations, some legitimate bugs can take years to fix, but they eventually do get fixed.

Funding the project was added to partially address the problem that there are lots of people seeking help and reporting bugs, but few
people who are willing or capable of providing help or fixing bugs.

## Description

<!-- Please add a clear and concise description of the bug. Try to
narrow the problem down to the smallest that exhibits the bug.-->

## How to Reproduce

<!-- Please show both the *input* you gave and the output you got in describing how to reproduce the bug, or give a complete console log with input and output

```console
$ trepan3k <command-line-options>
...
$
```

Provide links to the Python bytecode. For example, you can create a
gist with the information. If you have the correct source code, you
can add that too.

## Output Given

<!--
Please include not just the error message, but all output leading to the message, which includes echoing input and messages up to the error.
For a command-line environment, include command invocation and all the output produced.

If this is too long, then try narrowing the problem to something short.
