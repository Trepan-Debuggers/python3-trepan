# To the extent possible we make this file look more like a
# configuration file rather than code like setup.py. I find putting
# configuration stuff in the middle of a function call in setup.py,
# which for example requires commas in between parameters, is a little
# less elegant than having it here with reduced code, albeit there
# still is some room for improvement.

# Things that change more often go here.
