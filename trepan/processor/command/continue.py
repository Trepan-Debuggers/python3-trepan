Leave the debugger loop and continue execution. Subsequent entry to
the debugger however may occur via breakpoints or explicit calls, or
exceptions.

If a line position or function is given, a temporary breakpoint is set at that
position before continuing.

**EXAMPLES:**

    continue          # Continue execution
    continue 5        # Continue with a one-time breakpoint at line 5
    continue basename # Go to os.path.basename if we have basename imported

                                                 # the above using file
