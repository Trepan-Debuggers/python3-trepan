class AliasCommand(Mbase_cmd.DebuggerCommand):
    """**alias** *alias-name* *debugger-command*

Add alias *alias-name* for a debugger command *debugger-command*.  You
might do this if you want shorter command names or more commands that
have more familiar meanings.

Another related use is as a command abbreviation for a command that
would otherwise be ambiguous. For example, by default we make `s` be
an alias of `step` to force it to be used. Without the alias, `s`
might be `step`, `show`, or `set` among others.

Examples:
--------

    alias cat list   # "cat prog.py" is the same as "list prog.py"
    alias s   step   # "s" is now an alias for "step".
                     # The above example is done by default.

See also:
---------

`unalias` and `show alias`.
