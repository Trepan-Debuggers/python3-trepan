class TempBreakCommand(DebuggerCommand):
    """**tbreak** [*location*] [**if** *condition*]

    Sets a temporary breakpoint, i.e. one that is removed the after
    the first time it is encountered.

    See the help for location for what can be specified there.

    Without arguments or an empty *location*, the temporary breakpoint is
    set at the current stopped location.

    If the word `if` is given after *location*, subsequent arguments given
    a boolean condition which must evaluate to True before the breakpoint
    is honored.

    Examples:
    ---------

       tbreak                # Break where we are current stopped at
       tbreak if i < j       # Break at current line if i < j
       tbreak 10             # Break on line 10 of the file we are
                             # currently stopped at
       tbreak os.path.join() # Break in function os.path.join
       tbreak x[i].fn() if x # break in function specified by x[i].fn
                             # if x is set
       tbreak os.path:45     # Break on line 45 file holding module os.path
       tbreak myfile.py:45   # Break on line 45 of myfile.py
       break '''c:\\foo.bat''':1"  # One way to specify a Windows file name,
       break '''/My Docs/foo.py''':1"  # One way to specify path with blanks in it
