class BreakCommand(Mbase_cmd.DebuggerCommand):
    """**break** [*location*] [if *condition*]]

With a line number argument, set a break there in the current file.
With a function name, set a break at first executable line of that
function.  Without argument, set a breakpoint at current location.  If
a second argument is `if`, subsequent arguments given an expression
which must evaluate to true before the breakpoint is honored.

The location line number may be prefixed with a filename or module
name and a colon. Files is searched for using *sys.path*, and the `.py`
suffix may be omitted in the file name.

Examples:
---------

   break              # Break where we are current stopped at
   break if i < j     # Break at current line if i < j
   break 10           # Break on line 10 of the file we are
                      # currently stopped at
   break os.path.join # Break in function os.path.join
   break os.path:45   # Break on line 45 of os.path
   break myfile:5 if i < j # Same as above but only if i < j
   break myfile.py:45 # Break on line 45 of myfile.py
   break myfile:45    # Same as above.
