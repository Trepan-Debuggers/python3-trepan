Show information about how debugger treats signals to the program.
Here are the boolean actions we can take:

 * Stop: enter the debugger when the signal is sent to the debugged program

 * Print: print that the signal was received

 * Stack: show a call stack

 * Pass: pass the signal onto the program

If *signal-name* is not given, we the above show information for all
signals. If '*' is given we just give a list of signals.
