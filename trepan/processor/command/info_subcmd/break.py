class InfoBreak(Mbase_subcmd.DebuggerSubcommand):
    """**info breakpoints** [ *bp-number...* ]

    Show the status of specified breakpoints (or all user-settable
    breakpoints if no argument).

    The "Disp" column contains one of "keep", or "del", to indicate the
    disposition of the breakpoint after it gets hit.  "del" means that the
    breakpoint will be deleted.  The ""Enb" column indicates if the
    breakpoint is enabled. The "Where" column indicates the file/line
    number of the breakpoint.

    Also shown are the number of times the breakpoint has been hit,
    when that count is at least one, and any conditions the breakpoint
    has.

    Example:
    --------


        (trepan3k) info break
        Num Type          Disp Enb Off Where
        1   breakpoint    del  n     3 at /tmp/fib.py:9
        2   breakpoint    keep y    10 at /tmp/fib.py:4
                breakpoint already hit 1 time
        3   breakpoint    keep y    20 at /tmp/fib.py:6
                stop only if x > 0
