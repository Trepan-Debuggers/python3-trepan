    """**quit** [**unconditionally**]

Gently terminate the debugged program.

The program being debugged is aborted via a *DebuggerQuit*
exception.

When the debugger from the outside (e.g. via a `trepan` command), the
debugged program is contained inside a try block which handles the
*DebuggerQuit* exception.  However if you called the debugger was
started in the middle of a program, there might not be such an
exception handler; the debugged program still terminates but generally
with a traceback showing that exception.

If the debugged program is threaded or worse threaded and deadlocked,
raising an exception in one thread isn't going to quit the
program. For this see `exit` or `kill` for more forceful termination
commands.

---------

`run` and `restart` for other ways to restart the debugged program.
