class StepCommand(Mbase_cmd.DebuggerCommand):
    """**step**[**+**|**-**|**<**|**>**|**!**] [*event*...] [*count*]

Execute the current line, stopping at the next event.

With an integer argument, step that many times.

*event* is list of an event name which is one of: `call`,
`return`, `line`, `exception` `c-call`, `c-return` or `c-exception`.
If specified, only those stepping events will be considered. If no
list of event names is given, then any event triggers a stop when the
count is 0.

There is however another way to specify a *single* event, by
suffixing one of the symbols `<`, `>`, or `!` after the command or on
an alias of that.  A suffix of `+` on a command or an alias forces a
move to another line, while a suffix of `-` disables this requirement.
A suffix of `>` will continue until the next call. (`finish` will run
run until the return for that call.)

If no suffix is given, the debugger setting `different-line`
determines this behavior.

Examples:
---------

  step        # step 1 event, *any* event
  step 1      # same as above
  step 5/5+0  # same as above
  step line   # step only line events
  step call   # step only call events
  step>       # same as above
  step call line # Step line *and* call events

Related and similar is the `next` command.

See also:
---------

`skip`, `jump` (there's no `hop` yet), `continue`, `return` and
`finish` for other ways to progress execution.
