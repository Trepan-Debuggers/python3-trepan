Sets the events that the debugger will stop on. `all` can be used as
an abbreviation for listing all event names.

Changing trace event filters works independently of turning on or off
tracing-event printing.

Examples:
---------

  set events line        # Set trace filter for line events only.
  set events call return # Trace calls and returns only
  set events all         # Set trace filter to all events.

See also:
---------

`set trace`, `show trace`, and `show events`. `help step` lists event names.
