'''Some singleton debugger methods that can be called without first
creating a debugger object -- these methods will create a debugger object,
if necessary, first.
'''

# The following routines could be done via something like the following
# untested code:
# def _build_standalone(methodname, docstring=None):
#     def function(arg, arg2=None, globals=None, locals=None):
#         Debugger().getattr(methodname)(arg, arg2, globals, locals)
#        return
#    function.__name__ = methodname
#    function.__doc__ = docstring
#    return function
#
# But this a bit cumbersome and perhaps overkill for the 2 or so
# functions below.  (It also doesn't work once we add the exception handling
# we see below. So for now, we'll live with the code duplication.

Enter the debugger. Use like this:

    ... # Possibly some Python code
    import trepan.api # Needed only once
    ... # Possibly some more Python code
    trepan.api.debug() # You can wrap inside conditional logic too
    pass  # Stop will be here.
    # Below is code you want to use the debugger to do things.
    ....  # more Python code
    # If you get to a place in the program where you aren't going
    # want to debug any more, but want to remove debugger trace overhead:
    trepan.api.stop()

In situations where you want an immediate stop in the "debug" call
rather than the statement following it ("pass" above), add parameter
step_ignore=0 to debug() like this:

    import trepan.api  # Needed only once
    # ... as before
    trepan.api.debug(step_ignore=0)
    # ... as before


Module variable debugger_obj from module trepan.debugger is used as
the debugger instance variable; it can be subsequenly used to change
settings or alter behavior. It should be of type Debugger (found in
module trepan). If not, it will get changed to that type.

   Example:
   $ python
   >>> from trepan.debugger import debugger_obj
   >>> type(debugger_obj)
   <type 'NoneType'>
   >>>  import trepan.api
   >>>  trepan.api.debug()
   ...
   (Trepan) c
   >>> from trepan.debugger import debugger_obj
   >>> debugger_obj
   <trepan.debugger.Debugger instance at 0x7fbcacd514d0>
   >>>

If however you want your own separate debugger instance, you can
create it from the debugger class Debugger() from module
trepan.debugger.

Example:
  $ python
  >>> from trepan.debugger import Debugger
  >>> dbgr = Debugger()  # Add options as desired
  >>> dbgr
  <trepan.debugger.Debugger instance at 0x2e25320>

`dbg_opts' is an optional "options" dictionary that gets fed
trepan.Debugger(); `start_opts' are the optional "options"
dictionary that gets fed to trepan.Debugger.core.start().

Parameter "step_ignore" specifies how many line events to ignore after the
debug() call. 0 means don't even wait for the debug() call to finish.
