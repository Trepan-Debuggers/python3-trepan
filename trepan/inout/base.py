"""classes to support communication to and from the debugger.  This
communcation might be to/from another process or another computer.
And reading may be from a debugger command script.

For example, we'd like to support Sockets, and serial lines and file
reading, as well a readline-type input. Encryption and Authentication
methods might decorate some of the communication channels.

Some ideas originiated as part of Matt Fleming's 2006 Google Summer of
Code project.
