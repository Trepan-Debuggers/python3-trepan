# Below are the default debugger settings. The debugger object version
# of this may change. A setting is something a user may want to
# change, in contrast to settings that the debugger decides to set in
# the course of operation. For example, the maximum print width
# (width) is user settable, whereas whether the debugging program is
# running (execution_status), or traceback frame isn't user settable
# so it doesn't appear below.  Some settings like the current frame
# (curframe) or the number of steps to skip before entering a command
# processor (step_ignore) are shared between the two.  They also don't
# generally appear as settings.
