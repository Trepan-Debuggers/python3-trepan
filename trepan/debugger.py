"""Debugger class and top-level debugger functions.

This module contains the `Debugger' class and some top-level routines
for creating and invoking a debugger. Most of this module serves as:
  * a wrapper for `Debugger.core' routines,
  * a place to define `Debugger' exceptions, and
  * `Debugger' settings.

See also module `cli' which contains a command-line interface to debug
a Python script and `core' which contains the core debugging
start/stop and event-handling dispatcher and `client.py' which is a
user or client-side code for connecting to server'd debugged program.
